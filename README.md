A lightweight Blender add-on designed to speed up common animation workflows. This toolset provides precise 3D Cursor alignment, snap-to-cursor keyframing, and fast viewport playblasts—all accessible from a single panel in the 3D Viewport.

Built with animators in mind, it focuses on quick posing, blocking, and review without disrupting your existing workflow.
